# Backup FFmpeg static binaries for CLI Tests

**This repository keeps alternate backup of few FFmpeg static binaries from:**

* https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/ (_Licensed GNU General Public License version 3_)
* https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ (_Licensed GNU GPLv3, and LGPL v3.0_)

**required for my other projects CLI Tests that are prone to failure if any of these sites goes down. So I made a temporary backup of files I needed(grouped by date). _All credits and ownership belongs to their rightful owners._**
